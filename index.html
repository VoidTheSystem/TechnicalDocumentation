           The SAP program allows us to manage business operations and customer relations. This documentation will cover the section that deals with the usage of SAP within the Technical Department.

                    Notification Creation

            The notification is a number that the Technical Department uses to log a problem. All notifications are problems that need to be solved by acting on them as soon as possible. When a customer books in a product, we create the problem notifaction for that product and we give the notification number to the customer in the form of a notification sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            On SAP, go to transaction <code>IW51</code> (Create Service Notification). it will ask for a notifiation type, enter <code>SN</code> by typing it into the space or choose from the list by clicking the block next to the input space and press enter. on the next screen you only need to fill in the material which is the SAP code for the product you want to book in
            to SAP, for example <code>D5EVO_R</code> is the SAP code we use to identify a repair of the D5 Evo Sliding Gate Operator.

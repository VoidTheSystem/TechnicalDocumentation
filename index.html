                    Notification Creation

        <p>
            The notification is a number that the Technical Department uses to log a problem. All notifications are problems that need to be solved by acting on them as soon as possible. When a customer books in a product, we create the problem notifaction for that product and we give the notification number to the customer in the form of a notification sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            On SAP, go to transaction <code>IW51</code> (Create Service Notification). it will ask for a notifiation type, enter <code>SN</code> by typing it into the space or choose from the list by clicking the block next to the input space and press enter. on the next screen you only need to fill in the material which is the SAP code for the product you want to book in
            to SAP, for example <code>D5EVO_R</code> is the SAP code we use to identify a repair of the D5 Evo Sliding Gate Operator.
        </p>

    <section id="Order_Creation" class="main-section">

                <h2>
                    Order Creation
                </h2>
                
        </header>
        <p>
            To create an order from a notification, you go to <code>IW52</code> and insert the notification number for which you want to create an order. It will then open the page which allows you to change the notification. You will see two tabs on the top, one called <code>service order</code> and another called <code>sales order</code>. The <code>service order</code> will be chosen for most orders as this allows the order to sit on the system and wait to be accepted, unlike a sales order which needs to be processed once created. Once you selected <code>service order</code>, click on the <code>Location</code> tab and fill in the three company details tabs. This step is very important as it tells the system which branch it needs to push the stock to, once the order has been accepted. Then select the <code>Components</code> tab and starting filling in the codes and quanitities required.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Take note that only physical stock items can be inserted in the components list.</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>Once all the components have been inserted, click on the <code>Save</code> icon at the top and the order number will be displayed in the infomation tab at the bottom of the screen, it is good practice to write this number on the notification sheet for easy access in the future.</p>
    </section>    
    <div id="breaker"></div>
    <section id="Quotation_Creation" class="main-section">
        <header>
                <h2>
                    Quotation Creation
                </h2>
                
        </header>
        <p>
            To crate a quotation from the notification, the service order must first be completed as you cannot create a quotation without the order number which is used as a reference. If you do not have an order number, you would have to type out all the components on a new quotation which does not link to the notifaction. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Go to SAP operation <code>DP80</code>. This allows you to create a quotation using a reference, which is our order number in this case. If you have just created an order and not processed any other documents then you would notice that SAP has already inserterd your order number number. Enter the order number if it is not already entered, then press the <code>Quotation Button</code> at the top of the screen. The screen should change and you would now see a screen with all the items from the order. Some items will carry over as an item called <code>materials</code> and you need to check which item(s) is missing from the list and replace <code>materials</code> with the correct item(s) and quanities. The labour repair charge also needs to be inserted on the quotation depending on the item being repaired and zero cost needs to be applied to the applicable items, such as covers and o-rings. Once you are satisfied with the quotation, click the <code>Save</code> icon on the top left of the screen and the quotation will save and you will see the quotation number appear in the info bar at the bottom of the screen which again is good practice to write down on the hardcopy of the notification sheet.
        </p>
    </section>
    <div id="breaker"></div>
    <section id="Accepting_Quotation" class="main-section">
        <header>
                <h2>
                    Accepting Quotation
                </h2>
                
        </header>
        <p>
            Once a customer gives a go ahead on a repair, you need to go into the notification <code>IW52</code> , click on the <code>customer</code> tab and update the coding and description by adding what method the customer used to give the go ahead. This update allows for good traceability of communication with the customer and at what stage the repair is currently if someone else were to view this notification. After updating the notification, click on <code>Service Order</code> , this will take you to the order. Click on <code>Order</code> on the top left, go to functions and click on <code>accept quotation</code> . The order has now been accepted and a debt memo is automatically created with the exact contents of your quotation and the debt memo number will appear on the bottom of the screen which can be written down on the hardcopy of the notification sheet.
        </p>
    </section>
    <div id="breaker"></div>
    <section id="Releasing_Order" class="main-section">
        <header>
                <h2>
                    Releasing Order
                </h2>
                
        </header>
        <p>
            The order should only be released once the quotation has been accepted and the debt memo reflects the items on the order. If there are items in the order, that are not in the debt memo, then it means that those items will be picked for free. If there are items in the debt memo that are not in the order, then it means that those items will be omitted but it is still going to be billed. 
        </p>

        <p>
            To release the order, you need to go into the notification <code>IW52</code> , click on <code>Service Order</code> , this will take you to the order. Click on the <code>Green Flag</code> on the top left and then go back to the notification and save the notification. A message will appear at the bottom of the screen indicating that the order has been released. If there are no stock of the required items, you will get an error message with three options which will allow you to display the missing parts, cancel the releasing of the parts or release the order anyway. It is useful to view the missing parts so that you can check if the codes are correct and the importance of the missing parts. It is best to release the order so that the system can pull the stock into the branch with the next order.
